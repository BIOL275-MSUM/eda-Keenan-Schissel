## Abstract
The state of Minnesota is ranked number 10 in the United States for Health care andranked number 18 for its economic status. These are some very great and very high numbers but how do the counties fair on an individual level? The number 1 county in overall health in Minnesota as of right now is Carver county while the lowest ranked county is Mahnomen county. I plan to do an exploratory data analysis and compare these two counties in their Social and economic factors and their quality of life to see if there is a correlation between the two. The data set that i will be obtaining this information from is County Health Rankings and Roadmaps. With my results from this, I plan to see whether or not the economic and social factors in counties play a role in quality of life
## Introduction

## Methods

### Data Acquisition
-I found my data on countyhealthrankings.org
-I went to look at the county health rankings only in Minnesota
-Then I proceeded to download all the Minnesota data by choosing the excel sheet and click download
-after the data was download i moved it over into my data folder for R studio
Finally, I read the data in R

### Data Preperation
- For my data I used Rsudio version 1.3.1093 (Rstudio Team 2020)
-This version can be found in R version 4.03(R Core Team 2020)
-I downloaded my data from excel which was obtained by usin gthe packages dplyr (Wicham et. al 2020) and readxl (Wickham and Bryan 2019)
-Then I made read_excel become the function download data which allows the excel file to be readable in R
_Finally I used the glimpse function in order to preview the data and then used the transmute function to use the datasets i want to compare for my final analysis
